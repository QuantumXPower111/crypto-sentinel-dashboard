# Setup Instructions for Visual Studio Code

Based on the provided PDF walkthrough for similar Python-based applications (adapted for this Streamlit dashboard), here's an optimized setup process in VS Code. 
This focuses on a clean, efficient development environment with virtual environments, formatting, debugging, and integration for Streamlit, Web3, and PyTorch. 
No Docker is needed unless you plan to containerize for deployment, as this is a standalone script.

Install Required Software:
Visual Studio Code (latest version).
Python 3.9+ (download from python.org).
Git (for version control).

Install VS Code Extensions (Search in Extensions panel: Ctrl+Shift+X):
Python (Microsoft) – For IntelliSense and running code.
Pylance – Enhanced type checking and auto-completions.
Black Formatter – Auto-formatting on save.
autoDocstring – Generate docstrings.
Jupyter – If you want to test PyTorch snippets interactively.
Thunder Client – For testing APIs (e.g., Venice AI or CoinGecko).
Python Environment Manager – For virtual env handling.
